  "Observations of a service -> a statement about its availability. Pure.

  Written because the alternative is a status page that asserts. A page saying
  *all systems operational* with nothing behind it is worse than no page: it is
  read as a measurement, it is quoted back in a contract dispute, and it is
  right by construction — it says the same thing during an outage.

  So the whole library is organised around one distinction that assertion-based
  status pages do not have:

  ## Unobserved is not up

  A window nobody probed produces `:unobserved`, never 100%. This is the same
  rule as `authn.usage`'s unmeasured month and it is the same failure: silence
  and success are indistinguishable on the output, and they mean opposite
  things. A prober that dies quietly then reads as perfect availability, which
  is exactly backwards — the moment you can least trust the number is the
  moment it looks best.

  ## A prober that could not run is not an outage either

  Three outcomes, not two. `:up` and `:down` are claims about the service;
  `:inconclusive` is a claim about the probe — DNS failed on the prober's own
  network, the laptop was asleep, the token expired. Counting those as downtime
  understates the service and, worse, teaches everyone to ignore the number.
  Counting them as uptime is the lie in the other direction. They are excluded
  from the ratio and reported separately, so the reader can see how much of the
  window was actually observed.

  ## Coverage is part of the statement

  `:availability/coverage` is the fraction of the window that produced a
  conclusive observation. An availability of 100% over 4% coverage is not a
  good month; it is an unmonitored one, and the statement says so rather than
  leaving the reader to notice."
